            <hr/>

            <p>
                Kabanero is built on foundational open technologies that install onto a Kubernetes cluster. 
                Applications are deployed using an integrated Kubernetes-native toolchain using enterprise-grade 
                deployments infused with Kubernetes expertise. The applications being deployed will be based upon 
                a set of curated collections, which this install will activate a default set of featured collections.
            </p>

            <p>
                Typically this experience is performed by a cloud operations team, although anyone skilled in 
                setting up Kubernetes can also install Kabanero.

            <h3>Before Install Requirements</h3>
            <p>
                The Kabanero Foundation is installed in a Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes must first be installed. 
                Today Kabanero has been tested on the Origin Community Distribution of Kubernetes(OKD) version 3.11. 
                There is intent to also expand testing on upstream Kubernetes in the future.</p>

                    Use Kabanero to build applications that are ready for deployment onto Kubernetes and Knative,
                    without having to spend time defining container images, build infrastructure, or Kube yaml.
                    Focus on developing new applications and let the Kabanero tools do the heavy lifting of building and
                    packaging deployment-ready containers.
                    Go ahead and try it for yourself, using extensions to your favorite IDE, or our command-line tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our first ‘Try it’ experience is the Kabanero Development Experience, which includes Eclipse
                    Codewind and Appsody.
                    You can learn more about these open source projects below. Additional ‘Try it’ experiences will be
                    coming very shortly.
